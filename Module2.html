                In most English-speaking countries, a kebab may be the classic shish kebab or shashlik – small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer[1][2] – or, outside of North America where it is better known as gyros,[3] the more recent and now-ubiquitous fast-food doner kebab.[2][4] By contrast, in Indian English[5][6] and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a kebab is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese chuan.
